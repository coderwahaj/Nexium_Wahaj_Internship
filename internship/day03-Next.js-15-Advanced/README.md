# Day 3 â€“ Advanced Routing in Next.js 15

## âœ… What I Did

- Implemented various routing techniques using the App Router:
  - **Basic Routing** (e.g., `/about`, `/contact`)
  - **Nested Routing** with shared layouts
  - **Dynamic Routing** using `[id]`
  - **Catch-All & Optional Catch-All Routing** using `[...slug]`
  - **Custom Not Found Page** using `not-found.tsx`

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
cd internship/day03-routing
pnpm install
pnpm dev
