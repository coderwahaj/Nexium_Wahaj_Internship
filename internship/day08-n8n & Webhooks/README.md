# Day 8 - Nexium Internship

## 📅 Summary

On **Day 8**, I focused on learning and practicing **n8n**, an open-source workflow automation tool. I explored its interface, understood how nodes and triggers work, and specifically worked on **webhooks** and basic automation workflows.

---

## 🎥 Topics Covered

- Introduction to n8n and its interface
- Understanding Nodes, Workflows, and Executions
- Creating a basic workflow
- Using **Webhooks** to trigger workflows
- Connecting different services through HTTP requests
- Error handling and debugging in n8n

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- What n8n is and how it's different from tools like Zapier or Integromat
- How to set up and configure **Webhook triggers**
- How to build workflows visually using drag-and-drop nodes
- How data flows between nodes and how to reference previous node data
- Use of expressions and parameters to customize workflow logic

---

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice

I created the following sample workflows:

1. **Webhook-based Form Submission:**
   - Trigger: Webhook
   - Action: Send confirmation email via SMTP

2. **GET API Integration:**
   - Trigger: Manual
   - Action: Call public API and extract data

3. **Error-Handled Webhook:**
   - Trigger: Webhook with validation
   - Action: Conditional logic with error responses

---

## 📌 Outcome

- Developed a strong foundational understanding of **n8n**.
- Successfully created multiple automation workflows.
- Understood the importance of webhooks and how they can integrate external systems into n8n flows.

## 🚀 Tools Used

- [n8n](https://n8n.io) (local instance)
- Postman (for webhook testing)
- VS Code (for inspecting raw payloads)
